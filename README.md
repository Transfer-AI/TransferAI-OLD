# TransferAI

This application was started at the 2017 Hack-OHIO hackathaon held at The Ohio State University in October, 2017 (http://hack.osu.edu/2017/). The goal was to create an Android application that would search through students buckeyemail (OSU's e-mail server) and automatically create Google calendar events. The application would accomplish this by prompting the user for e-mail senders that should be included, learning the format of e-mails from these senders, and finally generating Google calendar events from any future e-mails from any of those addresses. The application, at the time in a bare-bones state, was one of the finalists of the hackathon and winner of the "Rockwell Automation Challenge" sponsored by Rockwell Automation (https://www.rockwellautomation.com/). Currently, the team is working to bring the application closer to a deployment state in time for Show-OHIO (http://hack.osu.edu/show/2018/), a followup to Hack-OHIO where students present their ongoing projects and their progress made.

Due to changes in design and resource requirements, this idea will cease to be an Android application and will be further developed as a Python script. See Transfer-AI/TransferAI for current project.
